**Mouse Color Change Rectangle**
This simple JavaScript project creates a dynamic rectangle that changes color based on the mouse position. When the mouse is on the left side of the rectangle, it gradually changes the color to red, and when on the right side, it changes the color to blue.

Features
Interactive Rectangle: Move your mouse over the rectangle, and witness the color transition from red to blue or vice versa.

Dynamic Color Change: The color transition is based on the mouse position relative to the center of the rectangle.
